# brd2json
**ULP for Eagle and Fusion 360 Electronics which generates a JSON representation of the board.**

The primary purpose is to integrate with [openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom](https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom), as the format of the objects in the generated JSON file is aligned with the internal data structures used in that tool.

## Implementation Status
Presently (Jan 2 2021) the integration with InteractiveHtmlBom is still a work in progress residing on my fork: [Funkenjaeger/InteractiveHtmlBom](https://github.com/Funkenjaeger/InteractiveHtmlBom/tree/eagle_support).

The ULP is not yet feature-complete, but enough of the baseline capability is in place for it to be generally usable.  The highest-priority to-do items, in no particular order, include:
* Text
* Polygons
* ULP code cleanup
* Support extra data fields for each component (To appear as additional columns in generated BOM)

## Usage
* With your board open in Eagle or Fusion 360, simply run the ULP and the JSON file will be automatically generated
* Next you need to locate the file:
  * If you're using Eagle, it should just save <boardname>.json to the project directory
  * If you're using Fusion 360, it's a little trickier - the project is in the cloud, so the file gets buried away deep in a temporary directory.  On Windows 10, for me it ends up in:
  
    `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\Neutron\ElectronFileOutput\<autogenerated gibberish>\<boardname>.json`
* Finally, pass the .json file as an argument to InteractiveHtmlBom. This is the same as the method listed in the wiki for processing an EasyEDA JSON file.

  `python generate_interactive_bom.py "<path>\<boardname>.json"`
